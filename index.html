<h1>Hi, I’m Jocelyn.</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawai’i but I now live in Brooklyn, NYC with my husband and two young children.  </p>
<p>I'm the founder of a company that has built a mobile programming environment designed for kids, called <a href="https://www.gethopscotch.com/">Hopscotch</a>. 
  Millions of amazing software projects and games by kids are published on it.</p>
<p>I am interested in: Hawai’i, human interaction, the design of systems, education, 
  and reducing the tremendous number of things that are wasted in the world. </p>
<p>I try to live my life with aloha.</p>
